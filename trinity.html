<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. </p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="trinity-tower.jpg"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has a beautiful campus with very well maintained grounds. It is a small liberal arts school that offers a broad education to all of its students. It has a high student to teacher ratio and the needs of each student are the school's top priority.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are its great student housing and the amount of work that goes into making each student successful. Trinity has been the best school for me so far for these reasons. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because I wanted to keep my options open in terms of my future career by getting a well-rounded education. Also, after having gone to such a large high school I realized a smaller school was a better environment for me.</p>
<p>I hope to major in Art because I enjoy it very much and I would love to perhaps become an art teacher someday. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
